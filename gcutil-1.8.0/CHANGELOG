Release 1.8.0 (release date: 2013-05-15):
=========================================

New Features:
-------------

  - Added support for v1beta15 Google Compute Engine API.
    (addresses, regions, per-zone machine types, aggregated lists)

  - Added 'gcutil config' command, an alias for 'gcutil auth'.

  - When prompting the user to select an image, gcutil will include standard
    images (CentOS, Debian).

  - With v1beta15 API, gcutil will use aggregated list API call by default.
    Aggregated list method will aggregate all resources across all scopes
    in which the resource of that type exist (for example, aggregated list
    of instances will list instances in all zones).

  - Users can specify image from the standard project by specifying image name
    prefix. For example: 'gcutil addinstance my-instance --image=debian-7'

Bug Fixes:
----------

  - When moving instances using 'gcutil moveinstances', if some of the instances
    depend on deprecated resources (image, kernel), gcutil will warn before it
    proceeds with the migration (migration would fail). New flag
    --replace_deprecated will create instances in the destination zone with
    dependencies on deprecated resources updated to recommended replacement
    resources.

Other Changes:
--------------

  - List commands will display all resources by default. Number of resources
    listed may be limited using --max_results flag. --fetch_all_pages flag
    is now deprecated.

  - Improved display of images and kernels list. By default, only newest
    kernels/images will be displayed when listed or when user is prompted to
    select an image or kernel. Use '--old_images' or '--old_kernels' to list all
    images or kernels, respectively.

  - When listing imges, the standard images (CentOS, Debian) will be listed in
    addition to images from the specified project. To list images in the
    specified project only, use --nostandard_images flag.

  - When prompting user to select a machine type, gcutil displays machine type
    description in addition to the name.

  - Removed support for v1beta13 Google Compute Engine API.

Release 1.7.2 (release date: 2013-03-11):
=========================================

New Features:
-------------

  - Added two new commands attachDisk and detachDisk, which can be used
    to attach/detach a persistent disk to and from running virtual
    machine instance.

Bug Fixes:
----------

  - Fixed an issue where list operations were incorrectly capped at maximum
    number of results of 100.

Other Changes:
--------------

  - Improved display of project's IP addresses in gcutil getproject.

  - Deprecation information is now printed for deprecated resources.

  - Removed support for v1beta12 Google Compute Engine API.

  - Fixed an issue where gcutil moveinstances did not handle instances without
    external IP addresses properly.

  - Fixed an issue where gcutil resumemove validated the log file incorrectly.


Release 1.7.0 (release date: 2013-02-07):
=========================================

-------------

  - Added a new subcommand, gcutil moveinstances, for moving instances (and
    their persistent disks) from one zone to another.

Bug Fixes:
----------

  - Added --zone flag to gcutil listdisks.

  - Fixed a bug where gcutil addsnapshot would crash if the --zone flag was not
    specified.

--------------

  - Added zone column to the table output of gcutil listoperations.

  - Increased the timeout of synchronous operations from 2 minutes to 4 minutes.


Release 1.6.1 (release date: 2013-01-31):
=========================================

Bug Fixes:
----------

  - Fixed an issue with adding a boot disk when creating a new instance.

  - Changed the setinstancemetadata and setinstancetags subcommands to generate
    a client-side error if no fingerprint is specified.

  - Fixed an issue where deleting per-zone resources would fail when using
    v1beta13.


Release 1.6.0 (release date: 2013-01-30):
=========================================

New Features:
-------------

  - Added support for v1beta14 per-zone resources.

  - Added a new subcommand, gcutil setinstancemetadata, for setting instance
    metadata.

  - Added a new subcommand, gcutil setinstancetags, for setting instance tags.

  - Added a new subcommand, gcutil deprecateimage, for setting the deprecated
    field on an image resource.

  - Added support for specifying a root persistent disk when creating a new
    instance:

      gcutil addinstance my-instance --disk=my-disk,boot

Other Changes:
--------------

  - Changed the ordering of the machine type prompt when creating instances so
    the standard machine types show up first, followed by the highcpu and
    highmem machine types.


Release 1.5.0 (release date: 2012-12-14):
=========================================

New Features:
-------------

  - Added subcommands for interacting with snapshots.


Release 1.4.1 (release date: 2012-11-12):
=========================================

Bug Fixes:
----------

  - Fixed crash in gcutil when waiting for images to be ready after creation.


Release 1.4.0 (release date: 2012-11-06):
=========================================

New Features:
-------------

  - Added a new subcommand, gcutil getserialportoutput, for getting the serial
    port output from an instance.

Bug Fixes:
----------

  - Fixed an issue where gcutil waited for instances that failed to be created.

Other Changes:
--------------

  - Changed the zone selection feature to display maintenance information next
    to the zone names.

  - Changed the display of operation resources to show the user responsible for
    the operation.


Release 1.3.4 (release date: 2012-10-11):
=========================================

New Features:
-------------

  - Implemented batch adddisk. It is now possible to add multiple disks with a
    single call to gcutil adddisk.

  - Implemented batch delete operations for additional resources. It is now
    possible to delete multiple disks, firewalls, images, instances, networks,
    operations, and snapshots.

  - Added a --format flag for the list subcommands. The flag accepts the
    following values: table, sparse, json, csv, and names. --format=names allows
    gcutil to be used with Unix tool pipelines:

      gcutil listinstances --format=names | xargs gcutil deleteinstance --force

Bug Fixes:
----------

  - Fixed the sorting in list subcommands. Instead of sorting each page
    individually, gcutil now sorts all results before displaying them to the
    user.

  - Changed --cache_flag_values to not cache flags when the underlying command
    fails.

Other Changes:
--------------

  - Deprecated --project_id in favor of --project. --project_id still works, but
    will produce a warning.

  - Reconfigured the version checking to take place when gcutil exits.

  - Improved documentation for firewall commands.

  - Removed the --page_token flag.

  - Changed the headings for list and get subcommands. The new headings use
    dashes instead of spaces and are in lower-case. This eliminates the need
    to use quotes with the --sort_by flag and makes the display of the headings
    more user-friendly.


Release 1.2.0 (release date: 2012-08-28):
=========================================

New Features:
-------------

  - Added support for gs:// URLs to the addimage command.

  - Implemented support for multiple flag cache files. gcutil now searches for
    a .gcutil.flags file starting in the current directory, followed by the
    parent directories, and the home directory until a file is found.

Bug Fixes:
----------

  - Added a check to commands dealing with metadata to warn the user of
    duplicate metadata keys instead of silently ignoring duplicates.

  - Fixed an issue where listoperations would not fetch multiple pages when
    encountering an operation that contains an error.

Other Changes:
--------------

  - Changed the way gcutil is packaged.

  - Made some of the flag descriptions and an error messages more informative.
